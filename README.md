# DJINN
Incident management tool created to learn coding again, because it's always useful. <br />
<ul>
  The main module is composed by:
  <li>Django</li>
  <li>Boostrap 4</li>
  <li>PostgreSQL</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  For the chat module I added:
  <li>Django Rest Framework</li>
  <li>Channels</li>
  <li>Redis (previously running in a docker container inside an Ubuntu VM due to Windows Home not having Hyper-V, now on Azure)</li>
</ul>
